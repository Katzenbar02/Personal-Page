# Overview

I create a website in HTML and CSS that show cases my projects, introduces me, and allows other people to contact me through social media or email.

I wanted to show-off my projects that I have completed over my time in BYU-Idaho. This includes my classes for CSE 210, CSE 310, and WDD 130. THis website will link to all my social media pages and shows who I am for future employers or people that want to get to know me.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code - This is an IDE that allows me to code and use several differnetn languages and organize my code. 

HTML - I used html to create a website that showed off my programming knowledge. This includes: adding images, links, transitions, adding fonts and icons, and creating buttons.

CSS - I used css to make my website look more professional and clean. This created fonts for all words, fad-in colors, color schemes, borders, and backgrounds.
